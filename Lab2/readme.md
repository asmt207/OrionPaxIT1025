##### Hard Drives and Memory
A hard disk is a non-volatile device designed to store data, applications, and an operating system on a computer for a long time. Hard drives are composed of magnetized round plates of metal or glass that rotate at speeds from 5,400 to 15,000 rpm.
Random access memory (RAM) is a module for recording and storing temporary information data needed by the processor to implement program operations. RAM is a memory in which access to the required memory cell is performed directly, without involving other modules. A feature of this type of memory is volatility, that is, information is stored in it only when a computer is turning on.
